Hannah Folk Employee Tracker
=======

## Description

This is my employee tracker, created using node.js and mysql.

## Process

I began by formatting the inquirer prompts and then built each individual function from there. Updating employee's role was the most difficult because I had figure out how to make the asynchronous calls.
